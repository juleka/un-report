This report was prepared to the attention of the United Nations. It analyzes the relationship between a country's GDP, its life expectancy. Our goal is to determine to what degree a country’s economic strength or weakness may be related to its public health status. We hypothesize that  life expectancy increases with a country's GDP.

```{r load_data}

```{r plot_gdp_lifeexp}
ggplot(data=gapminder_1997) +
  aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) +
  geom_point()
